# Barebones NodeJS + Express Boilerplate

Simple `babel` & `eslint` presets have been set up. Please refer to the scripts in `package.json` to find out how the production, development and test scripts are run.

**For production:**
```
npm run start
```

**For development** (with nodemon):
```
npm run start-dev
```

**For testing** (mocha + chai):
```
npm run test
```
